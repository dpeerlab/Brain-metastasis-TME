Analysis of stromal cells (all non-cancer cells) from experiments 1

This notebook provides example scripts for adapting Milo to detect differential phenotypic distribution of stromal cells from Experiment 1 (w/o transcription and translation inhibitors) and generates the major results in Figure S3.

Note that each run gives slightly different results (as index cells for the phenotypic neighborhoods are randomly selected), while data presented in the manuscript are also provided in the Data directory.

```

```{r}

               dimred="umap", point_size=0.5)
```

Differential abundance testing

Create a Milo object:
For differential abundance analysis on graph neighbourhoods, we first construct a Milo object. This extends the SingleCellExperiment class to store information about neighbourhoods on the KNN graph.
```{r}
sce <- Milo(sce)
```

Construct KNN graph.
```{r}
sce <- buildGraph(sce, k = 15, d=ncol(reducedDim(sce, "PCA")), reduced.dim = "PCA")
```

Defining representative neighbourhoods on the KNN graph

"For sampling you need to define a few parameters:
prop: the proportion of cells to randomly sample to start with (usually 0.1 - 0.2 is sufficient)
k: the k to use for KNN refinement (we recommend using the same k used for KNN graph building)
d: the number of reduced dimensions to use for KNN refinement (we recommend using the same d used for KNN graph building)
refined: indicates whether you want to use the sampling refinement algorith, or just pick cells at random. The default and recommended way to go is to use refinement. The only situation in which you might consider using random instead, is if you have batch corrected your data with a graph based correction algorithm, such as BBKNN, but the results of DA testing will be suboptimal."
```{r}
sce <- makeNhoods(sce, prop=0.1, k = 15, 
                  d=ncol(reducedDim(sce, "PCA")), refined = TRUE, reduced_dims = "PCA")
```

Once we have defined neighbourhoods, it’s good to take a look at how big the neighbourhoods are (i.e. how many cells form each neighbourhood). This affects the power of DA testing. We can check this out using the plotNhoodSizeHist function. Empirically, we found it’s best to have a distribution peaking above 20/distribution peaking between 50 and 100. Otherwise you might consider rerunning makeNhoods increasing k and/or prop.
```{r}
plotNhoodSizeHist(sce) 
```

Counting cells in neighbourhoods

Milo leverages the variation in cell numbers between replicates for the same experimental condition to test for differential abundance. Therefore we have to count how many cells from each sample are in each neighbourhood. We need to use the cell metadata and specify which column contains the sample information.

(Use colData(sce) <- DataFrame(...) to add observations)
```{r}
sce <- countCells(sce, meta.data = data.frame(colData(sce)), sample="sample")
```

This adds to the Milo object a 𝑛×𝑚 matrix, where 𝑛 is the number of neighbourhoods and 𝑚 is the number of experimental samples. Values indicate the number of cells from each sample counted in a neighbourhood. This count matrix will be used for DA testing.
```{r}
head(nhoodCounts(sce))
```

Reasoning for the tests:
1. Do not have the strict replicates (e.g., 2 samples for the HCC1954-BrM_Unlabeled cells)
2. Assume the Unlabeled cells of the 2 models are biologically identical (replicates)
3. Classify the samples into 3 groups: Unlabeled, TN-labeled, HER2+-labeled
4. Test if any neighborhood has differential abundance for labeled cells or HER2+- vs. TN (triple-negative))-labeled (with p values adjusted)
5. Use the original common dispersion estimate 

Step-wise implementation of testNhoodsL
Implement hypothesis testing in a generalized linear model (GLM) framework, specifically using the Negative Binomial GLM implementation in edgeR
Analogy to edgeR: "neighborhood = gene"
```{r}
# Only of the labeled population
dge <- DGEList(counts=nhoodCounts(sce), lib.size=log(colSums(nhoodCounts(sce))))
```

Experimental design
```{r}
sce_design <- data.frame(colData(sce))[,c("sample","group_refined")]
sce_design <- distinct(sce_design)
rownames(sce_design) <- sce_design$sample

# Add the info. of model (cell line) & mCherry labeling status s
sce_design$model <- sapply(strsplit(sce_design$sample,"_"), `[`, 1)
sce_design$mCherry <- sapply(strsplit(sce_design$sample,"_"), `[`, 2)
```


```{r}
sce_design$group <- relevel(factor(sce_design$group), ref='Unlabeled')
model <- model.matrix(~group, data=sce_design)
model
```

```{r}
dge <- estimateDisp(dge, model)
plotBCV(dge)
fit <- glmFit(dge, model, robust=TRUE) 
```

To specify contrasts:
mod.constrast <- makeContrasts(contrasts=model.contrasts, levels=model)
```{r}
mod.constrast <- makeContrasts(TNvsHER2=groupTNBC_Labeled-groupHER2BC_Labeled, TNvsCtrl=groupTNBC_Labeled, HER2vsCtrl=groupHER2BC_Labeled, levels=model)

# Use glmLRT
da_results_TNvsHER2 <- as.data.frame(topTags(glmLRT(fit, contrast=mod.constrast[,"TNvsHER2"]), sort.by='none', n=Inf))

da_results_TNvsCtrl <- as.data.frame(topTags(glmLRT(fit, contrast=mod.constrast[,"TNvsCtrl"]), sort.by='none', n=Inf))

da_results_HER2vsCtrl <- as.data.frame(topTags(glmLRT(fit, contrast=mod.constrast[,"HER2vsCtrl"]), sort.by='none', n=Inf))

da_results_LabeledvsCtrl <- as.data.frame(topTags(glmLRT(fit, coef=2:3), sort.by='none', n=Inf))
```

Compute neighbourhood connectivity:
Milo uses an adaptation of the Spatial FDR correction introduced by cydar, which accounts for the overlap between neighbourhoods. Specifically, each hypothesis test P-value is weighted by the reciprocal of the kth nearest neighbour distance. To use this statistic we first need to store the distances between nearest neighbors in the Milo object. This is done by the calcNhoodDistance function (N.B. this step is the most time consuming of the analysis workflow and might take a couple of minutes for large datasets).
```{r}
sce <- calcNhoodDistance(sce, d=ncol(reducedDim(sce, "PCA")), reduced.dim = "PCA")
```

Performing spatial FDR correction with", fdr.weighting[1], " weighting"):

Inspecting DA testing results:
Inspect the distribution of uncorrected P values, to verify that the test was balanced.
```{r}
ggplot(da_results_LabeledvsCtrl, aes(-log10(SpatialFDR))) + geom_histogram(bins=50)
```

Build an abstracted graph of neighbourhoods for visualization
```{r}
sce <- buildNhoodGraph(sce)
```

We might also be interested in visualizing wheather DA is particularly evident in certain cell types. To do this, we assign a cell type label to each neighbourhood by finding the most abundant cell type within cells in each neighbourhood. We can label neighbourhoods in the results data.frame using the function annotateNhoods. This also saves the fraction of cells harbouring the label.
```{r}
da_results_LabeledvsCtrl <- annotateNhoods(sce, da_results_LabeledvsCtrl, 
coldata_col = "CT")
head(da_results_LabeledvsCtrl)

da_results_HER2vsCtrl <- annotateNhoods(sce, da_results_HER2vsCtrl, 
coldata_col = "CT")
head(da_results_HER2vsCtrl)

da_results_TNvsCtrl <- annotateNhoods(sce, da_results_TNvsCtrl, 
coldata_col = "CT")
head(da_results_TNvsCtrl)
```

Note: Here, we apply a few "tricks" to facilitate setting the color bar to the desired range.

By default, R's plotting functions automatically scale the color bar based on the minimum and maximum values in the data, without providing an easy way to manually adjust it. To ensure a consistent color bar across all four plots for the differential abundance tests (HER2BC and TNBC from experiments 1 and 2), we artificially add two data points representing the minimum and maximum log fold change values. These points are added to the cell type with the fewest neighborhood cells, making them easy to track and remove later.
```{r}
nr <- nrow(da_results_TNvsCtrl)
da_results_TNvsCtrl[c(nr+1,nr+2),] <- da_results_TNvsCtrl[1:2,]
da_results_TNvsCtrl[c(nr+1,nr+2),'logFC'] <- c(-9.165263,9.165263)
